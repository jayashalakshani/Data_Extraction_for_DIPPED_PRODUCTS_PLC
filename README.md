## Limitations

- **PDF Structure Dependency:** The accuracy of data extraction depends on the structure of the PDF. Highly complex or irregular tables may not be processed correctly.
- **Page Number Validation:** The script does not handle cases where the provided page number exceeds the number of pages in the PDF.
- **Network Dependency:** The script requires an internet connection to fetch the PDF from the provided URL.
- **Year-Specific Extraction:** The current implementation focuses on extracting data specifically for the year 2024. Data from other years will not be processed.
- **Error Handling:** Limited error handling for edge cases such as invalid URLs, network issues, or unsupported PDF formats.
